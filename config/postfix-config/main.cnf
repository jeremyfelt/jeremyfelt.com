# Postfix mail configuration for foghlaim.com

# Most things are in a default state, but I've done my best to parse the
# config explanation so that I kind of understand what I've gotten myself

# INTERNET HOST AND DOMAIN NAMES
#
# Internet hostname of this system. Used as a default value for other
# configuraiton parameters.
myhostname = mail.foghlaim.com

# Used as a default value for other configuration parameters
mydomain = foghlaim.com

# SENDING MAIL
#
# Specifies the domain that locally posted mail appears to come from. In
# our setup, we'll use the Debian default /etc/mailname to specify the
# domain. The only line in this file reads 'foghlaim.com'
myorigin = /etc/mailname

# RECEIVING MAIL
#
# Indicates that mail is being received on all network interfaces, which
# is the default setting
inet_interfaces = all

# The list of domains that this machine considers itself the final mail
# destination for.
mydestination = foghlaim.com, FOGHLAIMLinode, localhost.localdomain, localhost

# TRUST AND RELAYS
#
# By default, Postfix trusts any machines that are on the same subnet as
# this machine. This *could* end up weird on a VPS as we're sharing an IP
# range with a bunch of others.
mynetworks_style = host

# Of course, this directive explicitly limits mail to the current network,
# overrideing our mynetworks_style directive, but I like being explicit.

# Postfix will relay mail from anybody on this machine to any host. It will
# relay mail from other machines to only the domains specified in the
# following directive. This doesn't really do anything, as we aren't allowing
# relay mail from other machines, but I like being explicit. :)

# When no relayhost is specified, mail is routed directly to the destination.

# ALIAS DATABASE
#
# The alias_maps parameter specifies the list of alias databases used by the
# local delivery agent. I'm not entirely sure what that means yet.
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases

# The alias_database parameter specifies the alias database(s) that are built
# with newaliases. I'm not entirely sure what that means yet.
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases

# ADDRESS EXTENSIONS
#
# The recipient_delimiter parameter specifies the separator between user names
# and address extensions. This is one of my favorite mail things because I can
# use things like (jeremy.felt+possiblespam@gmail.com) to filter out things
# when I sign up for them. Leaving at the default of +
recipient_delimiter = +

# SMTP BANNER
#
# The smtpd_banner parameter specifies the text that follows the 220 code in the
# server's greeting banner. $myhostname MUST be specified at the beginning.
#
# I've made the decision to drop (Ubuntu) from the end of the default setting.
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name

# MISC
#
# Maximum size of any individual mailbox or maildir file. The documented default is
# a large value, but for some reason Postfix installed with this default of 0, which
# means that mailbox size is unlimited.

# The local biff service sends new mail notifications to users who have requested them
# through the biff command. We really have no need for this, but should specify no as
# the default is yes.
biff = no

# If this was enabled, Postfix would determine what to append to an email address that
# was sent without a domain (e.g. jeremy@foghlaim). In the Ubuntu install of Postfix,
# we are told that "appending .domain is the MUA's job" and this directive is set to no
# by default.
