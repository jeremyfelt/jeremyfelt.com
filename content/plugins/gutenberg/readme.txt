Block editor for WordPress. This is the development plugin for the new block editor in core. Warning: This is beta software, do not run on real sites!

== Description ==

The goal of the block editor is to make adding rich content to WordPress simple and enjoyable.

<strong>Warning: This is beta software, do not run on production sites!</strong>

The new post and page building experience will make writing rich posts effortless, making it easy to do what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or "mystery meat" embed discovery.

WordPress already supports a large amount of "blocks", but doesn't surface them very well, nor does it give them much in the way of layout options. By embracing the blocky nature of rich post content, we will surface the blocks that already exist, as well as provide more advanced layout options for each of them. This will allow you to easily compose beautiful posts like <a href="http://moc.co/sandbox/example-post/">this example</a>.
