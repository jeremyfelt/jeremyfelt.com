Regularly checks WordPress repository information for your plugins and stores in WordPress.

== Description ==

Local WordPress Plugin Repo stores specified plugins via a custom post type in WordPress. It then checks the WordPress.org plugin API twice a day for updated information about your plugin, including basic statistics and support thread information, and attaches that as post meta to the newly created custom post.

This is a developer oriented plugin, and should only really come in handy if you want your plugins from the official .org repo stored in a custom post type.

Note that you will probably need to account for a bunch of this post meta in your front end templates, otherwise the only real info you'll get is in the admin area.

== Installation ==

1. Install like any other WordPress plugin!
2. Or... [https://github.com/jeremyfelt/Local-WordPress-Plugin-Repo](fork/star/watch/etc on GitHub).
