Privacy-friendly analytics for your WordPress site

== Description ==

Koko Analytics is a privacy-friendly analytics plugin for WordPress. It does not use any external services, so data about your visitors is never shared with any third-party company.

Furthermore, no visitor specific data is collected and visitors can easily opt-out of tracking by enabling "Do Not Track" in their browser settings.

Stop sharing visitor data with third-party companies making money off that same data. Stop unnecessarily slowing down your website. Koko Analytics lets you focus on what is important and gives you all the essential metrics, while respecting the privacy of your visitors.

### Features

- **Plug and play**: After installing and activating the plugin, stats will automatically be collected.
- **Privacy**: No personal information or anything visitor specific is tracked.
- **GDPR**: Compliant by design.
- **Data ownership**: No external services are used. Data about visits to your website is yours and yours alone.
- **Performance**. Handles sudden bursts of traffic without breaking a sweat.
- **Metrics**: All the essentials: visitors, pageviews and referrers.
- **Cookies**: There is an option to not use any cookies.
- **Referrer spam:** Built-in blacklist to filter out referrer spam.
- **Cache**: Fully compatible with pages served from any cache.
- **AMP**: Tracks AMP powered pages too.
- **Open-source**: Code is released under the GPL 3.0 license.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin area, go to **Plugins > New Plugin**, search for **Koko Analytics** and click **Install now**.
1. Alternatively, [download the plugin files](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/koko-analytics.trunk.zip) and upload the contents of `koko-analytics.zip` to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin. Koko Analytics will start recording stats right away.
1. Access your analytics by browsing to *Dashboard > Analytics* in your WordPress admin area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Does this respect my visitor's privacy?
Absolutely, nothing that could lead back to the visitor is recorded. If the visitor has "Do Not Track" enabled in their browser settings, the visitor won't be tracked at all.

#### Does this use any external services?
No, the data never leaves your website. That's (part of) what makes Koko Analytics such a great choice if you value true privacy.

### Does this set any cookies?
By default, yes. But you can easily disable this in the plugin's settings. Without cookies the plugin can still detect unique pageviews, but not returning visitors.

### Will this slow down my website?
No, the plugin is built in such a way that it never slows down your website for your visitors. If there is any heavy lifting to be done, it is done in a background process.

In fact, because the plugin does not depend on any external services it is usually much faster than third-party analytics tools.

### No pageviews are being recorded.
This is usually a file permissions issue. The first thing to check is whether the `/wp-content/uploads/pageviews.php` file exists and is writable by your web server.

### How to only use cookies after consent?
First configure Koko Analytics to not use any cookies by default.

Then configure your cookie consent plugin to add the following code for visitors that have given consent:

`
<script>
window.koko_analytics.use_cookie = true;
</script>
`

### What is the definition of a "pageview"?
A pageview is defined as a view of a page on your site. If a user clicks reload after reaching the page, this is counted as an additional pageview. If a user navigates to a different page and then returns to the original page, a second pageview is recorded as well.

### What is the definition of a "visitor"?
A visitor represents the number of sessions during which your website or a specific page was viewed one or more times.
