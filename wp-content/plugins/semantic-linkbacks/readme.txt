Richer Comments and Linkbacks for WordPress!

== Description ==

Generates richer WordPress comments from linkbacks such as [Webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention) or classic linkback protocols like Trackback or Pingback.

The limited display for trackbacks and linkbacks is replaced by a clean full sentence, such as "Bob mentioned this article on bob.com." If Bob's site uses markup that the plugin can interpret, it may add his profile picture or other parts of his page to display as a full comment. It will optionally show collections of profile pictures, known as Facepiles, instead of the full setences.

Semantic Linkbacks uses [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) to get information about the linked post and it is highly extensible to also add support for other forms of markup.

== Privacy and Data Collection ==

This plugin collects data from sites that send webmentions for the purpose of displaying richer comments on a site. This data is under the control of the site owner. It is the personal responsibility of that individual or individuals to remove any information at the request of the original content creator. Over time, we will add additional tools to assist in doing so.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to mark up my site? =

Most modern WordPress themes support the older Microformats standard, which means the plugin should be able to get basic information from to enhance linkbacks. The plugin is most useful with webmention support(separate plugin) and sites/themes that support Microformats 2.

= Why Webmentions? =

[Webmention](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention) is a modern reimplementation of Pingback and is now a W3C Recommendation.

= What about the semantic "comment" types? =

The IndieWeb community defines several types of feedback:

* Replies: <http://indieweb.org/replies>
* Reposts: <http://indieweb.org/repost>
* Likes: <http://indieweb.org/likes>
* Favorites: <http://indieweb.org/favorite>
* RSVPs: <http://indieweb.org/rsvp>
* Tagging: <http://indieweb.org/tag>
* Listen: <http://indieweb.org/listen>
* Watch: <http://indieweb.org/watch>
* Read: <http://indieweb.org/read>
* Follow: <http://indieweb.org/follow>
* Classic "Mentions": <http://indieweb.org/mentions>

= How do I extend this plugin? =

See [Extensions](https://indieweb.org/Semantic_Linkbacks#Extensions)

= How do I add this into my plugin? =

The plugin will automatically enhance webmentions, trackbacks, and pingbacks with an avatar and additional context. It will also automatically add a facepile instead of individual comments, but this feature can either be turned off by an aware theme or under Discussion in your Settings.

= Why do some [emoji reactions](https://indieweb.org/reacji) not show up? =

Some emoji characters in webmentions you might receive, e.g. Facebook reactions from [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/), take more than two bytes to encode. (In technical terms, these Unicode characters are [above the Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)).) To handle them, you need MySQL 5.5.3 or higher, and your database and tables need to use the [`utf8mb4` charset](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-mysql.html). [Usually WordPress does this automatically](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/02/the-utf8mb4-upgrade/), but not always.

First, [follow these instructions](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/195046/relaunch-4-2-utf8mb4-databse-upgrade/244992#244992) to switch your MySQL database to `utf8mb4`. Then, make sure `DB_CHARSET` and `DB_COLLATE` in your `wp-config.php` are either unset, set to the blank string, or set to these values:

    define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');
    define('DB_COLLATE', 'utf8mb4_general_ci');

= Who made the logos? =

The Webmention and Pingback logos are made by [Aaron Parecki](http://aaronparecki.com) and the Microformats logo is made by [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/work/microformats/).

= Why are you providing avatars? =

The plugin attempts to store the URL to an actual profile image on the source site. The default avatar set by WordPress is only used if there is no such image found.

Even the WordPress default avatars are served by querying Gravatar.com which serves the file. Gravatar works by you providing an email address which it uses to match the image.
The majority of linkbacks enhanced by this plugin do not have email addresses therefore we know that gravatar will not have anything on file.

If there is no email address it will serve the local avatar. If there is an email, it will go out to gravatar.com and see if they
have a gravatar on file. If there is it will store the gravatar URL, otherwise it will store the URL for the local avatar if set.

The plugin uses a locally cached version of the mystery icon normally provided by WordPress and Gravatar.
